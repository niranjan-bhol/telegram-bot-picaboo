# Telegram Bot Blueprint

This project serves as a minimal starter template for building a Telegram bot using Python. It demonstrates how to structure a simple bot, manage the token securely, and connect with the Telegram Bot API using the `python-telegram-bot` library.

## Features

- Reads bot token from `token.txt`
- Uses `python-telegram-bot` library
- Basic command handling structure
- Clean and extensible codebase

## Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- python-telegram-bot library


## Getting Started

1. Install requirements
2. Create a file named `main.py` in the root directory and write the logic in it.
3. Create a file named `token.txt` in the root directory and paste your Telegram bot token into it (from [BotFather](https://telegram.me/BotFather)).
4. Run the bot: `python main.py`

## Note

This is not a fully functioning bot, but a blueprint to help you quickly build and scale your own Telegram bots.
